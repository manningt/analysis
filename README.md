# Overview
The program ```profitable.py``` reads a CSV file generated by SquareUp and generates a bar chart of tours per day.

# Generate the CSV from Squarespace
1. Navigate to [Reports > Item Sales](https://app.squareup.com/dashboard/sales/reports/item-sales)
2. select the period of interest - typically 'Last Year'
3. click 'Download' then 'Item Detail'.  This will generate and download a csv file with a name like: items-2024-01-01-2025-01-01.csv
4. optional: move the generated file from Downloads to the directory that has profitable.py

# Run the profitable program
1. In a terminal window go to the directory that has profitable.py
2. type: ./profitable.py
3. with the file selector, pick the csv file to be analysed
4. click the floppy disk icon which is at the bottom of the PNG in order to save the generate bar chart graphic as a PNG file.

Note: the PNG and CSV files are not included in source code control tracking of changes (git).

If running this program on macos, then you may have to install:
- [tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/installation/install-tkinter-mac/) which creates the 'file picker' dialog box.
- matplotlib: brew install python-matplotlib
